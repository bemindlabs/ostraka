# Homebrew formula, kept in-repo so a tap needs no second repository — which
# works, but only when the tap is given this repository's URL:
#
#   brew tap bemindlabs/ostraka https://github.com/bemindlabs/ostraka
#
# `brew tap user/repo` on its own resolves to `github.com/user/homebrew-repo`.
# The prefix is brew's, not the user's, so the bare two-argument form looks for
# a repository that does not exist. The README carries the URL form for that
# reason; changing one without the other breaks installing from a tap.
#
# The release workflow rewrites the version and the sha256 fields; the artifact
# name it parses is fixed by that workflow.
